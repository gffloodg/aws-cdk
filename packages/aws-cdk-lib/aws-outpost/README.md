# AWS::Outpost Construct Library


This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

```ts nofixture
import * as outpost from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-outpost';
```

This module does not allow you to create Outpost resources, as there are no L1 constructs for Outposts. This module allows you to lookup an Outpost
by it's ID or ARN so that the Outposts properties can be used in other parts of your stack.
